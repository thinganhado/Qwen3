Your task is to verify if the region description inside <think> matches the metadata of such region and if the localization in <answer> matches the described region. 

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Verify localization:
If the user message states an ID but the ID in <answer> is not the same, output "incorrect region".

2. Extract Fields:
Infer the following features from <Explanation> and output:
  - Time: speech or non-speech
  - Frequency: low, mid, or high
  - Phonetic: consonant, vowel, or unvoiced
If unsure about a field, output "ambiguous" for that field.

3. Verify against ground truth:
Compare the extracted fields to the provided region metadata. If there is any mismtach, output "mismatch metadata".

OUTPUT FORMAT (must follow exactly):
{
  "region_id": "...",
  "time": "speech/non-speech/ambiguous",
  "frequency": "low/mid/high/ambiguous",
  "phonetic": "consonant/vowel/unvoiced/ambiguous"
}
